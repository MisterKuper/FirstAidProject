            Accidents, injuries and illnesses can happen to us suddenly and anywhere. Therefore, the promptness of assistance 
            often depends on people who are near the victim (family members, colleagues, passers-by), especially if they have 
            first aid skills. First aid is a set of necessary measures aimed at preserving the life and health of the victim 
            until qualified medical assistance is provided.

                Stretching - damage to soft tissues (ligaments, muscles, tendons, nerves) under the influence of a force that does not 
                violate their integrity. Most often, stretching of the ligamentous apparatus of the joints occurs with irregular, 
                sudden and abrupt movements that go beyond the normal range of motion of this joint (when the foot is twisted, lateral 
                turns of the leg with a fixed foot, etc.). In more severe cases, a tear or complete rupture of the ligaments and joint 
                capsule may occur.

                If there is no pulse along with breathing, it is necessary to do an indirect heart massage.

                        fold your fingers into the lock. Pressing is carried out strictly with the base of the palm - your fingers should
